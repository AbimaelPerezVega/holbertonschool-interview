## 📌 Problem Breakdown  

### 🔢 **Heap Insert**  
- Implements **heap insertion** in a binary heap structure.  
- Focuses on **heap properties** (min-heap or max-heap) and maintaining the correct order.  

### 🔗 **Insert in Sorted Linked List**  
- Inserts a new node in a **sorted singly linked list** while maintaining order.  
- Emphasizes **pointer manipulation** and **linked list traversal**.  

### ♻️ **Linked List Cycle**  
- Detects whether a **linked list contains a cycle** using Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm.  
- Focuses on **slow and fast pointer techniques**.  

### 🔄 **Linked List Palindrome**  
- Checks if a **singly linked list is a palindrome**.  
- Involves **reversing half the list** and comparing values.  

### 🔐 **Lockboxes**  
- Determines if all lockboxes can be opened using available keys.  
- Implements **graph traversal (BFS/DFS)** to explore connectivity.  

### 📊 **Log Parsing**  
- Processes and **analyzes logs**, extracting meaningful data efficiently.  
- Focuses on **string manipulation and pattern recognition**.  

### ➕ **Minimum Operations**  
- Calculates the **minimum operations** needed to reach a target value.  
- Focuses on **mathematical patterns and dynamic programming**.  

### 🔢 **Palindrome Integer**  
- Checks if an **integer is a palindrome** without converting it to a string.  
- Uses **mathematical reversal techniques**.  

### 🌊 **Sandpiles**  
- Simulates **sandpile stabilization** in a 2D grid.  
- Focuses on **cellular automata and recursive stabilization**.  

### ✅ **UTF-8 Validation**  
- Validates whether a list of integers **represents valid UTF-8 encoding**.  
- Focuses on **bitwise operations and encoding rules**.
